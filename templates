# Templates Directory

This directory is reserved for template snippets and reusable response fragments.

## Usage

You can store common response templates here and reference them in your endpoint configurations.

## Example

**template_user.json:**
```json
{
  "id": "{{uuid}}",
  "created_at": "{{timestamp}}",
  "updated_at": "{{timestamp}}"
}
```

## Future Enhancement

In future versions, you'll be able to include templates using:
```json
{
  "response": {
    "user": "{{template:user}}"
  }
}
```
